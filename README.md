# Awesome Mobile Animations

A presentation I am giving at the [EdTech Developers Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/EdTech-Developers-Meetup/events/184368552/)
in London, June 2014.

The talk is about the fact that we (web developers) should try to up our game and make our animations more fluid.
It gives examples that use CSS3D, Canvas and WebGL. It lightly touches on some performance tips.


## Running locally [recommended!]

* npm install
* grunt
* Visit: http://localhost:8000

## Hosted version [not recommended!]

It's up on [Heroku](http://awesome-mobile-animations.herokuapp.com) but it's very doubtful that it will load properly
for you, because it has a large number of big embedded videos and gifs.
