# Awesome Mobile Animations

A presentation I am giving at the [EdTech Developers Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/EdTech-Developers-Meetup/events/184368552/)
in London, June 2014.

The talk is about the fact that we (web developers) should try to up our game and make our animations more fluid.
It gives examples that use CSS3D, Canvas and WebGL. It lightly touches on some performance tips.
